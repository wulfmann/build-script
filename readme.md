### Installation Instructions ###
Before starting, make sure you have the latest version of node installed on your system.

* Clone Repo

From the root directory of the cloned repo run: sh build.sh

This executes the build script which does the following:
* Makes sure that the wlfmnn.sh script in the /scripts directory is executable, and copies
it to the /usr/local/bin directory so that it can be run from anywhere.

* It creates the wlfmnn directory in user/your-username, and copies all of the necessary
files to it.

* It creates a wlfmnn-sites directory in the wlfmnn folder, which is where it generates a 
basic project.
